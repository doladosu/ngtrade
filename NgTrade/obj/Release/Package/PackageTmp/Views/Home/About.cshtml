                        NgTradeOnline launched its online trading service in April 2010. Our industry-first 
                        offer of trading Nigerian stocks online revolutionized the market for consumer trading 
                        of stocks listed on the Nigerian stock exchange across the globe. NgTradeOnline does 
                        not charge any fee to open accounts.
                        NgTradeOnline was created with the simple idea that training to trade Nigerian stocks 
                        should be made affordable, readily available and accesible to anyone from anywhere 
                        with interest in the Nigerian financial market.</p>
