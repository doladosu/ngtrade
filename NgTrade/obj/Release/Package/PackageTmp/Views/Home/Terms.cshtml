          <h3>
            33. Billing Process</h3>
          <p>
            Some licenses for NgTradeOnline Services are based on the number of computers registered,
            the volume of storage used, or both, as well as for ancillary or related services.
            Where your license fees are based in full or in part upon the amount of storage
            you use, your bill for NgTradeOnline Services will be based upon the greater of
            the storage amount shown on your computer or the storage amount maintained by NgTradeOnline,
            excluding the benefits of any data compression, file duplication or similar techniques
            performed by NgTradeOnline. The calculation of a storage bill will be based upon
            the price(s) for the NgTradeOnline Service licensed and may be based upon the average
            storage used during the Subscription Period, the storage as of the end of the Subscription
            Period, or another storage measure taken during the Subscription Period, depending
            on which services you have selected at the time of registration or renewal.</p>
          <p>
            Should NgTradeOnline bill you for your NgTradeOnline Service on a monthly or periodic
            basis you agree that NgTradeOnline will bill you exclusively in full month or periodic
            increments and that there will be no billing for partial months or periods for any
            reason. Any amounts billed are fully due and payable at the time the bill is rendered
            to you.</p>
          <h3>
            34. Billing Issues</h3>
          <p>
            You must notify us about any billing problems or discrepancies within sixty (60)
            days after they first appear on the statement you receive from your bank or credit
            card company or other billing company. Send such notification to us at the NgTradeOnline
            Contact Information indicated in Section 35 (NgTradeOnline Contact Information)
            below. If you do not bring such problems or discrepancies to our attention within
            that sixty (60) day period, you agree that you waive the right to dispute such problems
            or discrepancies.</p>

            to an entity or organization, or where an entity or organization makes the NgTradeOnline
            Services available to you, the entity or organization so licensed or giving you
            access may grant multiple individuals rights related to the management and Use of
