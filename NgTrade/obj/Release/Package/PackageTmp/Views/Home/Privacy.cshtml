            NgTradeOnline will process European Personal Information in accordance with the
            following principles:</p>
          <p>
            1. <b>NOTICE</b>. Where NgTradeOnline collects Personal Information directly from
            individuals in the EEA, we will inform them about the purposes for which we collect
            and use their Personal Information, the types of non-agent third parties to which
            NgTradeOnline may disclose that information, and the choices and means, if any,
            NgTradeOnline offers individuals for limiting the use and disclosure of their Personal
            Information. Notice will be provided in clear and conspicuous language when individuals
            are first asked to provide Personal Information to NgTradeOnline, or as soon as
            practicable thereafter, and in any event before NgTradeOnline uses the information
            for a purpose other than that for which it was originally collected.
            <br />
            <br />
            2. <b>CHOICE</b>. Where NgTradeOnline collects Personal Information directly from
            individuals in the EEA, NgTradeOnline will offer individuals the opportunity to
            choose (opt-out) whether their Personal Information is (a) to be disclosed to a
            non-agent third party, or (b) to be used for a purpose other than the purpose for
            which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual.
            For Sensitive Personal Information, NgTradeOnline will give individuals the opportunity
            to affirmatively and explicitly (opt-in) consent to the disclosure of the information
            to a non-agent third party or the use of the information for a purpose other than
            the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by
            the individual. NgTradeOnline will provide individuals with commercially reasonable
            mechanisms to exercise their choices.
            <br />
            <br />
            3. <b>ONWARD TRANSFERS TO AGENTS</b>. NgTradeOnline will obtain assurances from
            its agents that they will safeguard Personal Information through measures consistent
            with this Privacy Policy. Examples of appropriate assurances that may be provided
            by agents include: a contract obligating the agent to provide at least the same
            level of protection as is required by the relevant Safe Harbor Principles, the agent
            registering to participate in the Safe Harbor mechanism, or another method of assurance
            deemed adequate by the European Commission. Where NgTradeOnline has knowledge that
            an agent is using or disclosing Personal Information in a manner contrary to this
            Privacy Policy, NgTradeOnline will take commercially reasonable steps to prevent
            or stop the unauthorized use or disclosure.
            <br />
            <br />
            4. <b>SECURITY</b>. NgTradeOnline will take commercially reasonable steps to protect
            Personal Information in its possession from loss, misuse and unauthorized access,
            disclosure, alteration and destruction.
            <br />
            <br />
            5. <b>DATA INTEGRITY</b>. NgTradeOnline will use Personal Information only in ways
            that are compatible with the purposes for which it was collected or subsequently
            authorized by the individual. NgTradeOnline will take commercially reasonable steps
            to ensure that Personal Information is relevant to its intended use, accurate, complete,
            and current to the extent appropriate for its intended use.
            <br />
            <br />
            6. <b>ACCESS</b>. Upon request, NgTradeOnline will grant individuals commercially
            reasonable access to Personal Information that it holds about them. In addition,
            NgTradeOnline will take commercially reasonable steps to permit individuals to correct,
            amend, or delete information that is demonstrated to be inaccurate or incomplete.
            <br />
            <br />
            7. <b>ENFORCEMENT</b>. NgTradeOnline will conduct compliance audits of its practices
            to verify adherence to this Privacy Policy. Any employee that NgTradeOnline determines
            is in violation of this Privacy Policy will be subject to disciplinary action up
            to and including termination of employment.
